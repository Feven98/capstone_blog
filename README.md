# Project Description

Guzo-Blog is an application that lets people to post about what they experienced and to share it with other people. The app name "Guzo-Blog" means "Travel-Blog". I want the app to let people share their journey in life that they think will help other peoples and also to get information by sharing their thoughts. So, that why I name it Guzo or travel.

In this application, people can create a post, can edit their post and also can delete their post if they want to. It also have an access to upload images using aws. Only the user can make all the above. The other users can see the post, make a comment and also can like or unlike the post if they want to. It will only shown if you have an account and logged in. 

This application is full crud with Django. Its user authenticated which gives the user full control of their account.
